# ETF Market Forecasting using VAR Model and Portfolio Optimization 
In this project, we aim to construct a portfolio of six ETF funds from different asset classes and sectors, and use the vector autoregressive (VAR) model to forecast future returns and the scipy optimization library to determine the optimal portfolio allocation and minimize the overall risk.


This project is particularly relevant in the current market environment, where investors are facing heightened volatility and uncertainty. By leveraging modern portfolio theory and time-series forecasting techniques, we aim to provide valuable insights into how investors can construct more effective and efficient portfolios.
